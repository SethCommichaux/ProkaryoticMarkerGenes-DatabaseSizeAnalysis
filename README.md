# ProkaryoticMarkerGenes-DatabaseSizeAnalysis

This repository contains the analysis scripts and data for the research study "Database size positively correlates with the loss of species-level taxonomic resolution for the 16S rRNA and other prokaryotic marker genes". 

## Study Abstract 

For many years, the 16S rRNA gene has played a critical role in the taxonomic classification of prokaryotic species and in profiling microbial communities. However, it has been criticized for its conservation level, which often prevents the differentiation between distinct species. This issue of species differentiation is not exclusive to the 16S rRNA gene; it extends to other marker genes as well. In our study, we have observed a gradual loss of species-level resolution in other marker genes as the size of the reference databases increases. Through the analysis of three widely used databases—the SILVA 16S rRNA gene database, the Genome Taxonomy Database (GTDB), and a collection of 40 single-copy genes that are informative taxonomically—we demonstrate that this loss of resolution reflects a deeper, intrinsic characteristic of the taxonomies themselves. This has significant implications for bioinformatic analyses, extending beyond mere taxonomic classification. To address these challenges, more precise and operationally relevant taxonomic definitions are necessary, alongside the use of multiple genomic markers in the classification process.
